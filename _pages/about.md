<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hi Guys✋, this is the BCI-VR research group at Nanjing University. we are supervised by [Dr. Guihuan Feng](https://software.nju.edu.cn/fenggh/). We are leading an *Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program for College Students*, starting from Sept, 2023.

We want to incorporate Brain-Computer Interfaces(BCI) with Virtual Reality(VR), aiming to explore human brain's potentials with BCI as well as to enhance the interaction in VR with BCI.

If you are interested about our program, please feel free to [contact us](mailto:shen.ouy03@gmail.com)!
